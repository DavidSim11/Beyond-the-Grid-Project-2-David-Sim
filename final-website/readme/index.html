<p>Reflection for Assignment 2 beyond the grid
Oksanen Media
by David Sim u3197534</p>
<p>Oksanen media is a photographer's website to showcase their photographers and a platform to connect with people to gain followers and get attention. The website uses eleventy 11th as the static site generator and incorporates markdown folders, CSS and HTML. The website purposely does not use javascript as the design choice keeping it simple and a website that a mobile device would access.</p>
<p>The approach I took to the website's design was to build it for a mobile device first. Luke Wroblewski (2011) explains that  “Designing for mobile first now can open up new growth opportunities, but it can also lead to a better overall user experience for a website or application”.This was also a significant design choice as I want the user to access the website on a mobile device because of the now widespread usage of QR codes. Having the user scan my QR code that takes them to the website is more probable than having someone type in the website address. This can be further used by including the QR code on cards and stickers. The build process of the website started with a low-fidelity prototype, which changed multiple times due to the limited amount of photographs and information available. Having the low-fidelity prototype was very useful in the design process as I could produce a working template of the website within hours of starting. David Verba (2008) explains that a low-fidelity prototype “keeps us focused on our actual goal. I have seen countless hours spent generating thousands of pages of documentation that were never used.” Using a low-fidelity prototype saved many design choices wasted and unnecessary hours dedicated to coding a website that I did not like. Incorporating working with a customer/the photographer on this assignment provided me with an example of how making a prototype is essential, so you do not go back with making the final site and then the customer not like it.</p>
<p>The website's design is influenced by photographers Peter McKinnon's and Peter Fisher’s websites in the layout choices and how I would show off the photographs. I used columns and rows mostly to show off all the information and images on the website. This is incorporated from Peter Fisher's website, where he uses the same style to show off all his photographs. This design is most straightforward to navigate, especially on a mobile phone. Peter McKinnon’s website was one of the first websites that I took influence from as it was how I would have liked my website to look, but due to my coding abilities and knowledge, I did not know how to get to that kind of final product exactly. I liked how simple the page was, and I used it in my footer, where it just included the social tags. The video on Peter McKinnon's site was the idea I was going for my hero element, but I could not achieve this due to my code not working how I wanted it to work. I used themes from both websites to influence the design of my website, so it could be recognised as a photographer's website using a contact section, an about section, and a gallery section were all implemented as they are recurring elements in each photographer's website. To improve my website, I want to learn how to implement more of the elements from Peter Mckinnon's and Peter Fisher's websites.</p>
<p>I resolved coding errors and most issues I ran into during the development, as I was able to use the first assignment as a reference of what code worked and what did not work to help me develop this website. I ran into issues with the code and embedding a video into the hero bar, which caused me to use a hero image instead and the youtube clip instead in a section of the website's contents. Using a static site generator was a brand new concept to me, and it was confusing how everything worked, having to have HTML tags and then the content put in the markdown folder was tricky to understand. I found it more challenging to do than the first assignment style. The more I used it, the less confusing I found it, but I ran into troubles with images and making the site responsive to devices. I overcame this by getting help and looking for answers on google to figure it out. By the end of the development of the website, I was competent in using a static site generator and using the style to build a website. In the future, I want to learn how to incorporate adding a navigation bar and using Javascript to add better style elements to my site and how I can make better use of videos. To add to my website, I would like to learn how to add video code elements such as an MP4 and create a better layout that uses the maximum width and height of the column without stretching the image like Peter Mckinnon's images.</p>
<p>My goal for the website was to provide a site that could be used as a platform to showcase the photographers' photographs and provide the user with the most straightforward navigation that provides a small amount of text with images that shows what the photographer does and how to contact them. Various aged customers will use the website with a background in automobiles. The use of a diverse range of photographs, such as the cars in a parking lot compared to the cars on the racetrack, shows off a wide range of what the photographer can do and provides the customer with a range of expectations. With my website development, I am most happy with the simplistic layout and how the content can be easily scrolled through and shows off many aspects of the photographer. The code was difficult to input as it was my first time working with a static site generator, but I took advantage of my situation and learned how to use the knowledge I gained from my previous website to create this website.</p>
<p>I intend for my website to be used as a showcase for the photographer's photographs and a platform where the photographer can use a shop and get employment opportunities through his listed contacts. I liked the overall design being simplistic, and I was able to show off all the required elements that needed to be included to show the correct theme for my website. With further understanding of using a static site generator and this style, I would like to improve upon the style elements and improve my overall coding capabilities to produce higher quality websites.</p>
